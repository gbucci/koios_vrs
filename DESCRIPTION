Description: Processes cancer variants from VCF, enriches data using the KOIOS 
    framework (HGVSg, OMOP concepts), integrates VRS identifiers, applies 
    frequency filters (AF < 1%), and formats the output into Phenopackets v2 JSON 
    for interoperable reporting of somatic/germline variants.
